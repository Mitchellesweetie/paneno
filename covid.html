<h1>Deconstructing the Covid 19 Pandemic- Security and Criminological Perspective</h1>

I open this argument with the famous words of Martin Njemoller (1892-1984) …. “First they came for the socialists and I did not speak out because I was not a socialist. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the Jews but I did not speak out because I was not a Jew. Then they came for me and there was no one left to speak for me.<br><br>

The Covid 19 pandemic is a global health crisis and most likely an economic crime with characteristics that border on bioterrorism. If this hypothesis is true, then the parties responsible should be in Jail for infringement on basic human rights and freedoms and the resultant   mass murders and grievous bodily harm as a result of the pandemic and /or, its related vaccines.<br><br>

One of the hallmarks of a  sovereign state in the contemporary international system is its ability to guarantee the security of its citizens and territory. It is therefore, the constitutional mandate of every democratic state to ensure that individual rights and freedoms are guaranteed and protected. These human rights form an important framework for socio-economic and cultural development and include the right to life.<br><br>

Despite the net effect the pandemic has had globally on socio-economic development and human security, the loud silence from the international community on those who are culpable leaves a lot to be desired. The international community has a responsibility to inspire confidence on matters security and safety in addition to upholding human rights and freedoms ever, more so in times of crisis such as now during the Covid 19 pandemic.  Many have lost lives, livelihoods, and freedoms not to mention the freedom of gathering and worship but despite this blatant infringement of the right to life and personal liberty, few human rights bodies and activists have risen to condemn the contravention.<br><br>

As cases of virus contraction and hospitalizations continue to rise globally, it has also been observed that there is a surge in Covid cases in countries that are fully vaccinated such as Gibralter, Iceland and Israel. This observation does raise questions on whether such vaccination is likely to be a medical error that is creating more complicated variants. Whereas it is important to develop COVID-19 treatments, any policy coercing individuals to take a Covid 19 vaccine without provision of adequate information on the resultant short and long term risks is not only immoral and unethical but also illegal. After all, any instruction, order, or regulation that is inconsistent with the spirit of the constitution is void to the extent of the inconsistency, and any act or omission in contravention of the spirit of the constitution is a nullity.<br><br>

In line with this, the office of the head of public service is thus out of order in coercing civil servants to take the vaccine. It is inadvertently incriminating itself by advancing the sinister agenda of criminals who mooted the Covid 19 virus and who should now be facing criminal charges in the International Criminal Court (ICC). As has always been the case with crimes of this nature, the US should have been the first to condemn the crime, then offer a reward to anyone with information leading to the arrest, transfer or conviction of the suspects. Its silence on this is suspect, or may be something is being done, and if so, then the first scene of crime should be somewhere in Wuhan, China. If not, this will however be a bad precedent that may exacerbate the notion that the international criminal court (ICC) is only meant for Africans.<br><br>

The vaccine’s questionable efficacy would therefore require that concerted efforts not be aimed at coercing individuals into taking vaccines (which in my view is a certain clique’s sinister and fraudulent agenda). Government efforts should be focused on finding a lasting balance between health, human rights and security for its populace by enforcing the law against any supposed criminal masterminds who may even right now be in the process of creating newer versions of the Covid 19 virus construed as new strains caused by antibody dependent enhancements (ADE). The role of the media, with its powerful positive potential in bringing attitudinal change and disseminating information is an important one in this multi-agency approach. Equally, the church, religious and civil society organisations have a role to play in creating a healthy balance of access to health services and respect of human rights and freedoms while condemning corruption and ensuring justice against perpetrators of evil agendas. Security agencies globally should also act with agility to probe the Covid 19 pandemic debacle and bring all suspects to book.<br><br>
